<h3>ABOUT ME :</h3>

<p>Hey everyone, I am Aswath aadityaa R pursuing computer science engineering at bannari amman institute of technology. I came to college with just a simple interest in computer science, starting days of college were something different, and have a simple basic routine and a group of friends. I came to know a software named BLENDER, the software attracts me from the starting as I need to be game developer when I was a kid, I started learning with the help of my friend and youtube. I thought a night skill class for I st year students of my college. Then a hackathon was announced in my college BIT HACKS, We created a team called United Desk and particpated, that was the first hackathon in my lifetime which was conducted for 36 hours , We worked it for many days with basic knowledge of Web Dev was thought on our first semester, We learn a lot from it... We won a prize in that but we need to create a professional website for the same theme we got and submit that website to the stakeholder and the coordinator mam who supported in all our situations, As a result, we started learning a course on web development with a result this page was created and will be updated often...
